## ✅ v1.0.0 Completed Tasks (SHIPPED 2026-01-02)

### Governance & Guardrails ✅
- [x] Guardrails enforcement system (allowlist-first, parameter schemas, risk tiers, budget tracking)
- [x] HTTP hardening with SafeClient (enforced timeouts, automatic retry, URL redaction)
- [x] Secrets management (env-only, CI scanning with trufflehog + gitleaks, `.env.example` parity)
- [x] Eval/exec elimination (AST-based safe_eval_expression, SafeCodeExecutor with allowlists)
- [x] Root `AGENTS.md` aligned with guardrail enforcement (sandbox deny-by-default, PII redaction, approval gates)
- [x] Guardrail CI gate (registry/AGENTS edits fail unless docs updated and `scripts/verify_guardrails.py` passes)

### Registry & Sandbox Enablement ✅
- [x] Registry-driven hot-swap flow (tool replacements via registry edits only, deterministic ordering)
- [x] Sandbox profiles enforced per registry entry (py/node slim/full, read-only mounts, `/workdir` pinning)
- [x] Observability and budget enforcement env keys wired (`AGENT_*`, `OTEL_*`, LangFuse/LangSmith)

### Observability & Tracing ✅
- [x] Comprehensive observability system (OTEL integration, Prometheus `/metrics`, Grafana dashboard with 12 panels)
- [x] Golden signals tracking (success rate, latency P50/P95/P99, tool error rate, mean steps per task, approval wait time)
- [x] Structured events (14 event types: plan, route, tool_call, budget, approval, execution, memory)
- [x] PII-safe logging with automatic redaction (secret/token/password keys recursively redacted)
- [x] Trace propagation (`trace_id` flows through all operations, thread-safe collector)
- [x] FastAPI backend `/metrics` endpoint wired (lines 92-100 in `src/cuga/backend/app.py`)
- [x] Guardrails module emits budget/approval events (`src/cuga/backend/guardrails/policy.py`)

### Configuration & Testing ✅
- [x] Config precedence enforcement (CLI > env > .env > YAML > TOML > defaults with ConfigResolver)
- [x] Config precedence tests (40+ tests validating resolution order and provenance tracking)
- [x] Tools/registry coverage (tests for tool selection, parameter validation, budget tracking)
- [x] Memory/RAG coverage (tests for profile isolation, retention, vector backend switching)
- [x] Observability tests (36 tests for events, golden signals, collector integration)
- [x] Guardrails tests (30+ tests for allowlists, schemas, egress, budget, approval)

### Deployment & Documentation ✅
- [x] Kubernetes manifests (deployment, services, configmaps, secrets, namespace, health checks)
- [x] Docker-compose image pinning (CI blocks `:latest` tags)
- [x] PRODUCTION_READINESS.md updated (rollout/rollback procedures, resource requirements)
- [x] SECURITY.md updated (6 new sections: sandbox, parameters, network egress, PII, approvals, secrets)
- [x] CHANGELOG.md v1.0.0 release notes with **Known Limitations section** (infrastructure-first release)
- [x] USAGE.md updated (config precedence, guardrail examples)
- [x] PROTOCOL_INTEGRATION_STATUS.md created (protocol status, v1.1 roadmap)
- [x] V1_0_0_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md with infrastructure status and v1.1 routing
- [x] AGENTS.md section 9 added with detailed v1.1 implementation routing

**Total v1.0.0 Work:** 8 major tasks, 2,640+ test lines, 130+ tests, 7 documentation files updated

## ⚠️ v1.0.0 Known Limitations (Documented)

**What Works (Production-Ready):**
- ✅ Observability infrastructure (collector, exporters, /metrics endpoint)
- ✅ Guardrails emit events (budget/approval operations)
- ✅ FastAPI backend integration
- ✅ Deployment manifests

**What's Missing (v1.1 Target):**
- ❌ Modular agents (`src/cuga/modular/agents.py`) don't emit events
- ❌ Agents use legacy `InMemoryTracer` instead of `ObservabilityCollector`
- ❌ No guardrail enforcement in agent execution paths

**Impact:** Infrastructure deployable, agents run "dark" (no plan/route/execute events in /metrics)

**See:** `CHANGELOG.md` "Known Limitations" section for detailed analysis and mitigation strategies

- [ ] Create examples showing protocol usage
- [ ] Update AGENTS.md with "Protocol Adoption Status" section

### Scenario Testing (2-3 weeks)

**Goal:** End-to-end scenario tests validating orchestration with real components

**Approach:** 8 enterprise workflows with minimal mocks

- [ ] Create `tests/scenarios/` directory
- [ ] **Scenario 1:** Multi-agent dispatch (planner → coordinator → workers with memory augmentation)
- [ ] **Scenario 2:** Memory-augmented planning (RAG retrieval → plan enrichment → execution)
- [ ] **Scenario 3:** Profile-based isolation (demo vs demo_power vs production profiles)
- [ ] **Scenario 4:** Error recovery (tool failure → retry → fallback → partial success)
- [ ] **Scenario 5:** Stateful conversations (multi-turn with conversation_id continuity)
- [ ] **Scenario 6:** Complex workflows (nested orchestrations with parent_context)
- [ ] **Scenario 7:** Approval gates (budget escalation → HITL approval → continue/reject)
- [ ] **Scenario 8:** Budget enforcement (warn → escalate → block flow)

**Estimated Effort:** 8 scenarios, ~1,200 lines, 2-3 weeks

### Test Coverage Improvements (1-2 weeks)

**Goal:** Raise layer coverage from 30% → 80% (tools), 20% → 80% (memory)

#### Tools Layer Coverage (tools 30% → 80%)
- [ ] Add handler execution tests (success/failure/timeout/retry paths)
- [ ] Add budget tracking validation (cost accumulation, ceiling enforcement)
- [ ] Add parameter validation tests (all ParameterSchema cases: type/range/pattern/enum)
- [ ] Add network egress tests (SafeClient enforcement, allowlist/denylist)
- [ ] **Estimated:** 30 tests, 600 lines, 2 days

#### Memory Layer Coverage (memory 20% → 80%)
- [ ] Add profile isolation tests (no cross-profile leakage with concurrent access)
- [ ] Add retention tests (memory persistence, dirty flush on shutdown)
- [ ] Add vector backend switching tests (Chroma/Qdrant/in-memory fallback)
- [ ] Add embedding determinism tests (local fallback, no remote calls)
- [ ] **Estimated:** 25 tests, 500 lines, 2 days

## 🚀 v1.1 Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Work Item | Effort | Dependencies |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Week 1 | Protocol shims | 2 days | None (start immediately) |
| Week 1 | Compliance tests | 2 days | Shims complete |
| Week 2-3 | Gradual migration | 5 days | Compliance tests passing |
| Week 2-3 | Scenario testing | 10 days | Parallel with migration |
| Week 3-4 | Coverage improvements | 4 days | Parallel with migration |
| Week 4 | Documentation | 3 days | All work complete |

**Total Estimated Effort:** 26 days (4-5 weeks with parallelization)

**Critical Path:** Protocol shims → Compliance tests → Gradual migration → Documentation

**Parallel Work:** Scenario testing and coverage improvements can happen alongside migration

## 🎯 Open Questions for Product Management

Before starting v1.1 work, need input on:

1. **Breaking Changes:** Is it acceptable to change agent signatures if we maintain backward compatibility wrappers?
2. **Migration Timeline:** Can we migrate calling code incrementally over multiple releases, or must it be atomic?
3. **User-Facing Benefits:** What's the user-visible value of protocol compliance? (vs internal architecture cleanup)
4. **Test Coverage Goals:** Is 80% layer coverage sufficient, or should we aim higher for critical paths?
5. **Scenario Testing Scope:** Are 8 scenarios sufficient, or should we cover more enterprise workflows?
